    "# Abstract \n",
    "Classification involves predicting discrete class labels for unlabeled data. given information on the data. The data we are working with is information from individuals' shopping trips at Walmart. The data is broken down into 7 observations, one of which is the trip type which tells us what type of shopping trip this customer was on, visit number which organizes the data into individual shopping trips, weekday that the trip was done on, UPC number of the item purchased, department of purchase and the fineline number which is a number that Walmart made helping us specify the items purchased. Given certain data such as what weekday it is, what department it was in, and what the UPC was, our goal is to be able to predict what type of shopping trip someone was on based off of a couple pieces of data.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Although supervised classification methods have been studied greatly throughout the years, research specific to this problem, on classifying a grocery trip based on the items bought remains low. There are multiple classification algorithms we can attempt in order to classify the 38 different types of shopping trips there are. K nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest classifiers, neural networks and logistic regression are commonly used in order to solve classification problems. Due to the low amount of research done in this specific problem area, this background section will be a small literature review of potential classification algorithms to use for our problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, K Nearest Neighbors works based on the idea that for a target variable, the k number of patterns nearest to that target variable can provide useful information in order to properly classify the target variable. KNN assigns the target variable the classification of the majority of the nearest neighbors [<sup>[1]</sup>](#kramernote). The downfalls of KNN are that there is no right 'K' to choose and it can be computationally inefficient. Second, Decision Trees are another classification method we want to attempt, these are popular due to their good accuracy scores and their computational efficiency </a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#srivastavanote). The random forest classifier works by using multiple tree classifiers where each classifier is generated by using a random vector and each tree vottes for the most 'popular' class to classify an input vector </a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#palnote). This paper uses random forests to classify remote sensing which they concluded was just as accurate as using a support vector machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks and logistic regression are other potential algorithms we would like to try to classif our data with, there was no literature on any similar classification task to our project but a paper revealed that these two algorithms share common roots in statistical pattern recognition and that neural networks can be seen as a type of generalization from logistic regression </a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#dreiseitlnote). Lastly, upon multiple attempts to find related work, Cui et al attempted this trip type classification using deep embedding logistic regression which incorporates logistic regression into a deep and narrow neural network </a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#cuinote). We are hoping as we implement some of these algorithms to produce results and a discussion that can help future research for stores like Walmart to improve customers' shopping experiences or help understand/solve problems similar to this."
